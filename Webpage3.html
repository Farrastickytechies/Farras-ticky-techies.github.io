                <p> Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens "Jeb" Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.</p>

                <p>Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation. It allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and a company, due to both co-founder Baszucki's lack of interest in press coverage and it being "lost among the crowd" in a large number of platforms released around the same time. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

            <p>Cookie Run: Kingdom is an action role-playing game by Devsisters and a spin-off serving as the sixth game within the overall Cookie Run franchise. Cookie Run Kingdom is a fight in a massive RPG battle simulator.[1] In this game, the player assumes the role of cookies. Each cookie has a unique character. The skill of the cookie will improve while playing the game and allow the player to advance on a higher level. The gameplay in this game is divided into two main types namely the Kingdom Development and Adventure. If a player cannot go through the stage, it can use treasures in in-game items that improve the team's powers. Players can find materials to enhance the character's abilities by raiding the levels or harvesting them from the Cookie Mansion.</p>
